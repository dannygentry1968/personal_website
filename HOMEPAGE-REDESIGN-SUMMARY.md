## ✍️ New Book Descriptions (Voice & Messaging)

### The Collapse (NEW)
> "This is the book superintendents don't want you to read. After 30 years watching the system grind down passionate educators, I'm pulling back the curtain on what's really broken—and offering a blueprint for fixing it. No corporate edu-speak. No false hope. Just honest truth from someone who's been in the trenches. If you care about the future of education, start here."

- "Honest truth from someone who's been in the trenches"

### The Kindness Tree (REFRAMED)

> In an age when character education often takes a backseat, this story offers something different. Follow young Joseph through a magical forest where seven ancient trees teach timeless virtues—kindness, courage, honesty, and more. Perfect for parents and educators who know that building good humans is just as important as test scores. A gentle reminder of what really matters."

This debut novel weaves mystery, suspense, and the complexities of small-town Texas into a page-turner you won't want to put down. Think Friday Night Lights meets True Detective—secrets, community, and the darkness lurking beneath the surface. A change of pace that showcases a different kind of craft."
