            <p>Yes, the little "cotton-top" kid with buck teeth is me.  This picture was taken on Thanksgiving Day at my Aunt Bobbie's house in Fort Worth, Texas in 1975.  I was in 2nd grade that year, and I remember that I had lots of fun playing in the back of that ugly old Ford station wagon.  Only my mom (who is standing behind me), my cousin George (who has his back turned), and I are still alive.  My Aunt Bobbie (in her house robe), my aunt and uncle, and my dad (who is on the far right) have all since passed away.</p>

            <p>When I was in Texas this past summer, I made a special trip to this house and sat out in front in my car for awhile.  I thought about all of the fond memories that we had there as a family.  I cried a bit.  My cousin sent me this picture after our visit this summer when we reminisced about those days of our childhood.  We laughed about how my Uncle Bill REALLY enjoyed eating.  He loved my mom's "dressing" (that's what southerners call Turkey Stuffing...I have a great recipe if you want it) and he couldn't wait each year for her to make it.  He always asked her if he could take some home afterwards, and always complimented her on how good everything was.  One time, I guess he just couldn't think of the right words to tell her how good it was and he said, "Hon, this fork fits my mouth just right!"  That was his way of saying, "This is just too awesome for words!"</p>

            <p>Years after this, and after my dad passed away, my wife and I took over the Thanksgiving cooking and hosting tradition.  My aunt and uncle came until they passed away a few years ago.  I do most of the cooking at our house, so Thanksgiving has always been a fun and busy time of cooking.  As you know, it takes lots of planning and work to make the big traditional meal.</p>

            <p>Since moving to California, I have to admit it has been difficult being so far away during this time of the year.  However, each year, we have had a great time with our NEW friends we have made here, and have enjoyed their homes and hospitality.</p>

            <p>Looking back on my life, I have a lot to be thankful for.  I certainly never dreamed in 1975 that I would be here in California working with wonderful people like you!  When I start to make a list of the things that I am thankful for, the list always gets longer and longer.  It gets so long, that I wonder what reason I really have to complain about anything at all.  I am thankful that I serve in a profession where I get the opportunity to give back to others, what has been so richly given to me.  The true power of Thanksgiving is that it turns our attention away from ourselves and opens our hearts and minds up to experiencing gratitude for the things we have and the opportunities that we have been given. It also encourages us to give back and to share with others.  As teachers, we have lots to share; and doing so with a grateful heart makes the job so much easier.</p>
