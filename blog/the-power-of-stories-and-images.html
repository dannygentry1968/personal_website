        <div class="article-content">
            <p>As you know, this year has been a difficult year for me personally, and I can't thank you all enough for your kind and uplifting words, prayers, and support.  Being far away from family my while they are hurting, and then to be far away from them when WE are hurting, is sad and frustrating at times.  However, you have made that separation easier, and my burden lighter, by making my job easier and by just being the excellent human beings that you are.  I feel truly blessed!  Rolling Hills is a special place because of you!</p>

            <p>In past issues of RedHawk tales, I have shared with you stories about myself and my family.  I have also attempted to make the case that stories are an important way that we connect to each other.  I have encouraged you to form deeper relationships with your students through the sharing of stories.  A few months ago, I also brought up the topic of symbols and the power they have in conveying ideas and wisdom in a densely packed format. We have all heard that old saying, "A picture is worth a thousand words" , and it turns out that the saying is ACTUALLY true!  Just think of how many books have been written on individual paintings done by the great masters such as Michelangelo or DiVinci.  This connection between stories and art is also a fundamental part of the human experience.  As kids, we enjoyed the "picture books" with the great illustrations that went along with the book.  Not only do we like good stories, we also like great works of art!</p>

            <p>In the modern world, we no longer rely as much on oral storytelling or the production of icons to communicate.  Sadly, we have been reduced to communicating via Social Media, text messaging, and emojis (YUK!!)  However, thanks to all of the hard work we have done as educators over the last two centuries, more people worldwide know how to read today than ever before!  In fact, early in the 19th century, only 12% of the world could read and write. Today 83% of the world's population can read and write.  Thank you teachers; you REALLY have been making a difference!</p>

            <p>For almost ALL of human history, people were separated from the wisdom locked within written language because they simply did not know how to read.  Knowing this, when the great Christian cathedrals were constructed in Europe during the "Dark Ages", the priests relied upon the stained glass and icons they created to help tell the stories they wanted to be told.  Even the architecture of the buildings themselves became part of the message they wanted conveyed.  Despite our culture having gone through a radical transformation in terms of communication since those days, people are STILL producing amazing stories, art and iconography.  The image I shared above is one such example.  It is a crayon & pencil drawing entitled, Mary and Eve by Sr. Grace Remington, OCSO, of the Cistercian Sisters of the Mississippi Abbey.  It is not a Christmas image in the traditional sense, but its elements DO tell a powerful story.</p>

            <p>Aside from its obvious religious origin, it is a great illustration of how much meaning can be packed into one single image.  It encourages us look at the world around us more deeply, and to extract the meaning that is embedded within it.  It also encourages us to reflect on the power of symbols and stories, and how they have had a profound impact on us as human beings.  It encourages us to go deeper.  As educators, this is something we should always be helping our student to do.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in learning more about the iconography related to this image, here is a link to an excellent article on the subject.</p>

            <p>Finally, I hope that you all have a wonderful and restful holiday with friends and family!  This has been a busy semester, and the next one will be even busier...so rest up and get ready!  Thanks again for all you do! Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!</p>
