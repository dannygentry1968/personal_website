            <p>Over the weekend, I found out that one of my older brothers has cancer.  It came as a shock to everyone in the family, so we really don't know what to think right now...so many questions, and not many answers.  I know he plans to fight it with all his might.  With the help of the doctors, his family and friends, and his faith, I am sure he has a great chance.  So, with all that, I would like to tell you all a little bit about him, because he really is an inspiration (apart from the whole cancer thing)...and that's what this section is all about anyway.  One thing is for sure; his life has made an impact.</p>

            <p>My brother's name is Don.  He's the oldest of us three brothers, me being the youngest.  He spent many years as a fireman and recently retired as the Director of Public Works in the town where he lives. Retirement for him basically meant that he changed offices and he now works at doing what he really loves; serving as the Director of the County Fire District.  I once told someone that if that town were ever to erect a statue to anyone based on their contributions to the city, it would be to my brother.  Over the course of his career, he has singlehandedly saved more lives, either directly or indirectly, than anyone else I know.  His direct efforts and hard work in managing, gaining funding, and training the first responders of his city has impacted the lives of countless individuals.  EVERY time there is a disaster, my brother is there putting himself into harms way.  He's trained hundreds of others to do the same, and he leads by example.  He never asks anyone to do something that he wouldn't do or hasn't done himself. Even though he's not in the field of education, he has a true gift for teaching others, and has gladly devoted his "off-duty" time to that purpose.</p>

            <p>A few years ago prior to his retirement, I talked to him and he shared with me about how burned out he was feeling.  He felt like he was always "on call" and he had to start having some down time.  So, he and his wife bought a travel trailer and started going to a nearby state park to spend most weekends.  They took their dogs, and welcomed family and friends to join them.  He realized that sometimes the stress of being a public servant can be too much, and he dialed it back.</p>

            <p>We only get one chance at this life, and the result is the same for all of us; it's terminal.  I reminded everyone last week of the sign that was on George Bailey's office in It's a Wonderful Life.  "All you can take with you, is that which you've given away."  My brother is a shining example of that.  He's spent his life serving others, and now he's beginning the fight of his life.  I know there will be many by his side, fighting right along with him.  He's spent his life giving away, and now he's about to receive.</p>

            <p>So, with that, your inspirational leadership assignment for this week is to think about a person who has made a positive impact on your life.  Call them up or go and visit them.  TELL THEM why your are coming to them, and tell them how they impacted you and thank them.  In doing so, you complete the circle. Your second assignment (if you choose to accept it), is to reflect on your life, your professional practice, and ask yourself what kind of impact are you having?  If it's not the kind of impact you had hoped for, then you are in luck; it's never too late to start.</p>
