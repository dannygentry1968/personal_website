## ⚠️ TONE CHECK

The new copy is **bold and direct**:

- "Superintendents don't want you to read"
- "No corporate edu-speak"

**This works if:**
- Danny is comfortable being seen as a challenger/disruptor
- He's okay with potentially alienating some school administrators
- He wants to attract educators hungry for honest conversation
- He's building a speaking/consulting brand around truth-telling

**Danny should confirm:**
✅ This is the voice/position I want  
✅ I'm comfortable being the "honest critic" of the system  
✅ This represents my actual views and brand
